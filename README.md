# A2RCAlgorithm-WORDAlgorithm
## Introduction
Pattern synthesis is one of the core problems of modern communication, and it has been widely concerned by people all the time. 

Although the traditional array pattern synthesis method can complete the synthesis of the desired pattern, it lacks certain flexibility, that is, when the target pattern changes, the weight vector of the array manifold must be completely redesigned. Therefore, Here I am trying my best to take flexible and precise array response control algorithm as the research topic, focusing on the newly proposed **_A2RC algorithm_** (an Accurate Array Response Control algorithm for pattern synthesis) and **_WORD algorithm_** (array response control based on Weight vector ORthogonal Decomposition). 

In this program, the corresponding control algorithm has been explored and researched. Also, I am **_the first one_** to use the above algorithm to simultaneously synthesize the main lobe and side lobes of the multi-main lobes target pattern in the uniform linear array and the non-uniform linear array with simultaneous constraints on the main lobe beam ripple and side lobe null steering.
